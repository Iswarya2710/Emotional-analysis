# Emotional-analysis

**Objective:**
Build a system to detect and understand emotions in text, audio, and video data.
Overcome challenges like interpretability (how the system explains its findings) and scalability (handling large data).

**Requirement:**
Downloading and setting up gender_net.caffemodel is essential to run the emotion analysis system.

# Emotion Analysis System

## Overview
This project builds a system to detect and understand emotions in text data using a pre-trained language model. It also includes functionality to download necessary model files like `gender_net.caffemodel`.

## Setup
1. Install the necessary libraries:
    ```sh
    pip install transformers torch
    ```

2. Run the emotion analysis script:
    ```sh
    python analyze_emotion.py
    ```

3. Download the required model:
    ```sh
    python download_model.py
    ```

## Usage
- Modify the `analyze_emotion.py` script to input your own text and analyze emotions.
- Use Git to manage and version control your project.

## Git Instructions
1. Initialize a Git repository:
    ```sh
    cd /path/to/your/project
    git init
    ```

2. Add and commit your changes:
    ```sh
    git add .
    git commit -m "Initial commit - Added emotion analysis code and model download script"
    ```

3. Connect to your remote repository and push the changes:
    ```sh
    git remote add origin https://github.com/yourusername/your-repository.git
    git push -u origin main
