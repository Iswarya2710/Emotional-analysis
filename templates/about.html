    <h2>Project Overview</h2>
    <p>
      Our web application enables precise deep learning-based classification of
      human emotions from video information, giving users an intuitive platform
      to investigate and compare cutting-edge affective computing models.
    </p>
    <h2>Problem Statement</h2>
    <p>
      This study uses many modalities, including visual, aural, and textual
      signals, to leverage deep learning to reliably characterize human emotions
      in dynamic video recordings.
    </p>
    <h2>Objective</h2>
    <p>
      The aim of this project is to create an intuitive web application that
      facilitates multimodal emotion recognition in video footage. Users will be
      able to upload movies, view the results of emotion recognition, and
      compare deep learning models with one another.
    </p>
    <h2>Feature</h2>
    <p>
      Our web application makes it easier to explore and assess deep learning
      models for multimodal emotion analysis in video content by letting users
      submit films and view the results of emotion detection.
    </p>
    <h2>Technology</h2>
    <p>
      Python is the main programming language used in this project, and Flask or
      Django is the web framework used for backend development. TensorFlow,
      PyTorch, or Keras are utilized in the implementation of deep learning
      models for multimodal emotion recognition. OpenCV is used for processing
      videos, and NoSQL or SQL databases are used for storing data. Version
      control is further facilitated with Git, and the web application is hosted
      for user access on Heroku or AWS.
